## Introduction

## Aim

### Website Objective

### Key Features

## Potential Users

### User Goals

- **Generate a letter**: The primary goal of users engaging with the website game is to write a love letter.

### User Testimonials

## Design \& Development

### 5 Planes of UX

#### Strategy

Create a simple, engaging Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock game site, including single and multiplayer experiences with user-friendly accessibility.

#### Scope

Include a Player v Player, as well as a Player v Computer part to the game. Use clear images to help show the user results, as well as to guide them through the process of the game.

#### Structure

A *Home* page where user/s can either choose to read instructions, or they can choose to start a game. Once they choose which game to start, they are guided through each round by messages and icons appearing on screen determined by their choice and either their friend's choice or the computer's choice, depending on the game. Once the game has been won/lost, the user returns to the *Home* screen, where the result is clearly shown, and they can start another game.

#### Skeleton

A simple title and 3 buttons(*Instructions*, *Play against the computer* and *Play against a friend*) appear when the pages loads. As gameplay commences, icons clealy representing the 5 choices appear for the user/s to choose from. All choices chosen are clearly shown, and results are clearly displayed for each round, as well as an overall score.

See [Wireframes](#wireframes) below.

#### Surface

A simple, two toned colour scheme is used throughout, to avoid distracting the user's focus from the game area. All clickable buttons and icons will highlight when hovered over, in order to show where the user can and cannot click. Icons will show frames to represent results: green symbolising a win, red symbolising a loss and grey symbolising a draw.

### Wireframes

#### Desktop \& Tablet

#### Mobile

### Features


## Technology \& Resources

- **IDE :** 
- **Languages :** HTML for basic page structure. CSS for styling. JavaScript for interactivity. Markdown for this readme.
- **Template :** The [CodeInstitute Gitpod template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) was used in order to install all the relevant tools for the code to function.
- [Github](https://github.com/) was used to host the project. Each author worked on their own self-titled branch before committing changes - after group approval - to the main branch.
- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) was used to create wireframes for mobile, tablet and desktop ???
- [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/) was used to find the page's favicon ???
- [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) and [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) testing tools were used to locate minor issues and check both accessibility and performance. 

## Deployment

Once the basic design of the website was finished, we deployed it to GitHub Pages. [The history of all deployed versions of the site can be found here](https://github.com/moabdelbasset/FebHackathon/deployments).

### How to Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Log in to [GitHub](https://github.com/).
2. Select *FebHackathon* from the list of repositories, of any of the authors.
3. Click Settings > Pages.
4. Under *Source*, select *Deploy from a branch*.
5. Under *Branch*, select *main* and */root*, then click *Save*.
6. Wait a couple of minutes for the site to deploy, then navigate back to the repository.
7. Click *Deployments*, which now should have appeared on the main repository page.
8. Under *Active Deployments*, click the link https://moabdelbasset.github.io/FebHackathon/. (The deployed page will open in the current tab).

### How to Clone Repository

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/moabdelbasset/FebHackathon/).
2. Click the green *Code* drop-down button.
3. Click *HTTPS* and copy the URL.
4. Open your IDE, and open a terminal.
5. Type `git clone url`, replacing `url` with the URL copied in step 3.

## Issues/Bugs

## Testing \& Validation

### Functional Testing of Website

#### Home Page

#### Other Page/s?

### Browser Testing

The above testing is performed using Chrome as the browser. These tests were repeated on the following browsers, all of which also passed in all criteria.

#### Mozilla Firefox

#### Safari

#### Microsoft Edge

#### Opera

### WAVE Evaluation Tool

WAVE revealed no errors and no contrast errors. As this needed to be tested throughout all moments of use, no single screenshot could show this.

### PageSpeed Insight Tests

### JSHint

JSHint returned no errors, (((only ____ warnings about functions being contained within other functions. This is deemed acceptable for this project and so does not need addressing))).

### HTML Code Validation

### CSS Code Validation

## Future Improvements/Development
